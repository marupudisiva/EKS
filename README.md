Configuring GitHub Secrets
To securely manage credentials and configuration:

AWS Credentials:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION
CLUSTER_NAME
These should be added as secrets in your GitHub repository.


How It Works
Terraform Configuration: The Terraform code sets up a VPC and EKS cluster in AWS using the Terraform AWS modules. It’s parameterized with variables for flexibility.

GitHub Actions Workflow:

It’s triggered on every push to the main branch.
It checks out the code, sets up Terraform, initializes and plans the Terraform deployment, and finally applies it if the branch is main.
After deployment, it configures kubectl to manage the EKS cluster using the credentials and kubeconfig provided by AWS.

Usage
Initial Setup:
Run terraform init in the eks directory locally to ensure the environment is correctly set up.
Deploying via GitHub Actions:
Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will automatically deploy or update your EKS cluster.
This setup provides a robust CI/CD pipeline for deploying an EKS cluster on AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions, automating your infrastructure management.
